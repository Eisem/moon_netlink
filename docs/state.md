# Declarative state model

`state` is pure and depends on `route`, with no socket or async dependency.
`NetworkSnapshot::new` copies Link/Address/Route/Neighbor collections and their
unknown-attribute collections, preserving every domain field. Immutable
payload bytes remain owned values.

Names identify desired links; indices reference objects in an observation.
`interface_name` and `link_by_name` return `None` for missing/unnamed objects.
A caller collects four dumps and constructs the snapshot. These observations
are not an atomic kernel snapshot. JSON and planning are separate tasks.
